### Analysis

- The data displayed on the graph shows a correlation between the weight and volume of the tumor.
- An almost equal amount of male and female mice were in the study. This removes any gender bias infleunce for the results of the test.
- Capomulin had the most time point tests out of any of the drugs and Propriva was the opposite. 
- The results also show the success of capomulin in reducing the volume of the tumor
- The results of the study are very consistent with only 1 outlier detected within infunobil and none on the other 3 drugs analyzed.
This further enhances the realibility of the tests with accurate and consistent data.
